1. [Emotion Analysis](https://github.com/LolipopnJoker/Movies_Emotion_Analysis) - Analyzing the correlation between movies' profits and the emotions in their script. This project demonstrates combining multiple data sources; cleaning and preparing the data, and performing both emotion analysis as well as correlation analysis.
