## Projects:
Currently, I've got three projects on my portfolio. While each one of them has a separate readme file, here is a short explanation on each one: 
1. [Emotion Analysis](https://github.com/LolipopnJoker/Movies_Emotion_Analysis) - Analyzing the correlation between movies' profits and the emotions in their script. This project demonstrates combining multiple data sources; cleaning and preparing the data, and performing both emotion analysis as well as correlation analysis.
2. [Happiness and Corruption Project](https://github.com/LolipopnJoker/Happiness_and_Corruption_Dashboard) - Since 2015 the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) is published annually, ranking the happiness of countries all over the world. In this project, I created a dashboard depicting aggregated data from the 2015 to 2020 World Happiness Reports.
3. [Inventory Project](https://github.com/LolipopnJoker/Inventory_Project) - Inventory management systems are widely used in retail and eCommerce businesses, allowing them to get insights on some of the business performances. With this in mind, I created a clone of a generic inventory management system database in MySQL. Furthermore, I created several Python scripts that automatically populate random data and insert it into the database. The last thing I plan to add to this project is a dashboard connected to the database. My main goal in this project was to sharpen my understanding of the data pipeline â€“ from users who enter the data into the system (mimicked by the Python scripts), to connecting the database to Tableau and building the dashboard.
